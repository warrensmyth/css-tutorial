<p>All together, these tutorials are giving me a lot of confidence in moving Westlawn’s technical ambitions forward in a meaningful way. For now it’s just my dad and I working through the paces to relaunch Westlawn into the modern webspace.</p>

<p>From there, the real fun begins. It is not by the efforts that we put in building the system that it will shine. It is from the feedback we receive that we will be able to craft something awesome. Until then, 1 day at a time, 1 line at a time, we’re working towards something important to us, which is the best feeling in the world.</p>
